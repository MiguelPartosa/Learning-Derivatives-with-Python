> [Repository for ML foundations](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations)

## What is this

A repository for notes in learning calculus for machine learning.

## Goals
-   Learn calculus needed for machine learning
-   Notes with examples in python
-   Along with calc, topics that are related to machine learning will be included when necessary.

## By the end

-   Finish the [neural network repository](https://github.com/MiguelPartosa/Nueral-Network)
